## Overview

This project is a **Spring Boot** application integrated with **LangChain4j**. It uses the **Maven Wrapper** to simplify the build process, ensuring consistent Maven versioning across different environments. The application leverages LangChain4j to build language model applications in Java, with Spring Boot handling the backend services.

## Requirements

- **Java 22**: Ensure that Java 22 is installed.
- **Maven Wrapper**: This project comes with a Maven wrapper (`mvnw`), so you donâ€™t need to install Maven globally.
- **Spring Boot 3+**: The project uses Spring Boot to build the web services.
- **LangChain4j**: Integrated for working with large language models (LLM).

## Features

- **LangChain4j** integration for natural language processing.
- REST APIs built with **Spring Boot** to expose LangChain capabilities.
- Ready-to-use Maven wrapper for easy build and execution.
